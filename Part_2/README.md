# Part 2.

Ipython notebook showing how label correlations can be used to fill in missing labels, and how filling in those labels subsequently improves ligand based virtual screening. 

`run_comparison.py` will generate label matrices using multiple threshold values from the correlation graph, and then use the block bootstrapping technique to show how these label matrices lead to improved performance.
