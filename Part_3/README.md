# Part 3

Demonstrating how to use clustering and merging to group ligand sets into their binding sites, which improves lbvs. 

Includes:
* Ipython notebook demonstrating analysis of the pre-computed results, as well as a demo of clustering a GABA-A Receptor ligand set with 4 binding sites.

* `cluster.py` which will run through the dataset and cluster+merge all target ligand sets

* `cluster_full` with the data from `cluster.py`
